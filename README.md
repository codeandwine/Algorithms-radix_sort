## Introduction 
Radix is a mathematical word that means the base of a number. In another words, our base ten number system has a Radix of 10. Similarly, our computer binary number system has a Radix of 2. Thus, the Radix sorting algorithm has to do with these concepts. This algorithm sorts integers by their radix, or digits, and runs another sort underneath to complete its purpose.
